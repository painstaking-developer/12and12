self-confidence. </span>
                <span id="pg22-p2-s3">Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned, self-confidence was no good whatever; in
fact, it was a total liability. </span>

to alcohol—an allergy, they called it. </span>
                <span id="pg22-p2-s7">The tyrant alcohol wielded a double-edged sword over us: first we were smitten by
an insane urge that condemned us to go on drinking, and then by an allergy of the body that insured we would ultimately
destroy ourselves in the process. </span>
                <span id="pg22-p2-s8">Few indeed were those who, so assailed, had ever won through in singlehanded combat. </span>

                <span id="pg23-p2-s2">Alcoholics who still had their
health, their families, their jobs, and even two cars in the garage, began to recognize their alcoholism. </span>
                <span id="pg23-p2-s3">As this trend
grew, they were joined by young people who were scarcely more than potential alcoholics. </span>

or fifteen years of literal hell the rest of us had gone through. </span>

                <span id="pg23-p3-s2">By going
back in our own drinking histories, we could show that years before we realized it we were out of control, that our
drinking even then was no mere habit, that it was indeed the beginning of a fatal progression. </span>
                <span id="pg23-p3-s3">To the doubters we could
say, “Perhaps you’re not an alcoholic after all. </span>
                <span id="pg23-p3-s4">Why don’t you try some more controlled drinking, bearing in mind
meanwhile what we have told you about alcoholism?” This attitude brought immediate and practical results. </span>
                <span id="pg23-p3-s5">It was then
discovered that when one alcoholic had planted in the mind of another the true nature of his malady, that person could
never be the same again. </span>
                <span id="pg23-p3-s6">Following every spree, he would say to himself, “Maybe those A.A.’s were right….” After a few

practice the A.A. program unless they have hit bottom. </span>

of attitudes and actions that almost no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream of taking. </span>

                <span id="pg25-p2-s2">How often
have we heard them cry out, "Look what you people have done to us! </span>
                <span id="pg25-p2-s3">You have convinced us that we are alcoholics and that
our lives are unmanageable. </span>

Higher Power can remove our obsession. </span>

he thinks, to admit alcohol has him down for keeps. </span>

something really impossible. </span>
                <span id="pg25-p3-s6">How he does cherish the thought that man, risen so majestically from a single cell in the
primordial ooze, is the spearhead of evolution and therefore the only god that his universe knows! </span>
                <span id="pg25-p3-s7">Must he renounce all

least I've found it so. </span>

demand that you believe anything. </span>

you don't have to swallow all of Step Two right now. </span>

                <span id="pg26-p3-s9">Third, all
you really need is a truly open mind. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p3-s10">Just resign from the debating society and quit bothering yourself with such deep
questions as whether it was the hen or the egg that came first. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p3-s11">Again I say, all you need is the open mind." </span>

                <span id="pg26-p4-s3">Naturally I respected, venerated,
even worshiped science. </span>

                <span id="pg30-p1-s3">We saw that we had to reconsider or die. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p1-s4">We
found many in A.A. who once thought as we did. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p1-s5">They helped us to get down to our right size. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p1-s6">By their example they
showed us that humility and intellect could be compatible, provided we placed humility first. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p1-s7">When we began to do that,
we received the gift of faith, a faith which works. </span>

                <span id="pg30-p2-s1">Another crowd of A.A.'s says: "We were plumb disgusted with religion and all its works. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s2">The Bible, we said, was full of
nonsense; we could cite it chapter and verse, and we couldn't see the Beatitudes for the ‘begats.' </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s3">In spots its morality
was impossibly good; in others it seemed impossibly bad. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s4">But it was the morality of the religionists themselves that
really got us down. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s5">We gloated over the hypocrisy, bigotry, and crushing self-righteousness that clung to so many
‘believers' even in their Sunday best. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s6">How we loved to shout the damaging fact that millions of the ‘good men of
religion' were still killing one another off in the name of God. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s7">This all meant, of course, that we had substituted
negative for positive thinking. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s8">After we came to A.A., we had to recognize that this trait had been an ego-feeding
proposition. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s9">In belaboring the sins of some religious people, we could feel superior to all of them. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s10">Moreover, we could
avoid looking at some of our own shortcomings. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s11">Self-righteousness, the very thing that we had contemptuously condemned
in others, was our own besetting evil. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s12">This phony form of respectability was our undoing, so far as faith was concerned. </span>
                <span id="pg30-p2-s13">But finally, driven to A.A., we learned better. </span>

                <span id="pg31-p1-s2">So it's not
strange that lots of us have had our day at defying God Himself. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s3">Sometimes it's because God has not delivered us the
good things of life which we specified, as a greedy child makes an impossible list for Santa Claus. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s4">More often, though,
we had met up with some major calamity, and to our way of thinking lost out because God deserted us. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s5">The girl we wanted
to marry had other notions; we prayed God that she'd change her mind, but she didn't. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s6">We prayed for healthy children,
and were presented with sick ones, or none at all. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s7">We prayed for promotions at business, and none came. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s8">Loved ones, upon
whom we heartily depended, were taken from us by so-called acts of God. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s9">Then we became drunkards, and asked God to stop
that. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s10">But nothing happened. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p1-s11">This was the unkindest cut of all. ‘Damn this faith business!' we said. </span>

                <span id="pg31-p2-s2">At no time had we asked what God's will was for us;
instead we had been telling Him what it ought to be. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p2-s3">No man, we saw, could believe in God and defy Him, too. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p2-s4">Belief
meant reliance, not defiance. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p2-s5">In A.A. we saw the fruits of this belief: men and women spared from alcohol's final
catastrophe. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p2-s6">We saw them meet and transcend their other pains and trials. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p2-s7">We saw them calmly accept impossible
situations, seeking neither to run nor to recriminate. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p2-s8">This was not only faith; it was faith that worked under all
conditions. </span>
                <span id="pg31-p2-s9">We soon concluded that whatever price in humility we must pay, we would pay." </span>

most A.A.'s, he is not. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s3">There are too many of us who have been just like him, and have found the riddle's answer. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s4">This
answer has to do with the quality of faith rather than its quantity. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s5">This has been our blind spot. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s6">We supposed we had
humility when really we hadn't. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s7">We supposed we had been serious about religious practices when, upon honest appraisal,
we found we had been only superficial. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s8">Or, going to the other extreme, we had wallowed in emotionalism and had mistaken
it for true religious feeling. </span>

                <span id="pg32-p2-s10">The fact was we really hadn't
cleaned house so that the grace of God could enter us and expel the obsession. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s11">In no deep or meaningful sense had we
ever taken stock of ourselves, made amends to those we had harmed, or freely given to any other human being without any
demand for reward. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s12">We had not even prayed rightly. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s13">We had always said, "Grant me my wishes" instead of "Thy will be
done." </span>

a key, and the decision to swing the door open. </span>

                <span id="pg34-p2-s6">We
saw that we were powerless over alcohol, but we also perceived that faith of some kind, if only in A.A. itself, is
possible to anyone. </span>

self-will which has always blocked the entry of God—or, if you like, a Higher Power—into our lives. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p3-s2">Faith, to be sure,
is necessary, but faith alone can avail nothing. </span>

insecurity worries him sick, and panic takes over when he thinks of all the bridges to safety that alcohol burned behind
him. </span>

now made more acute because he cannot use alcohol to kill the pain, can be solved, too. </span>

that our friend’s life is still unmanageable even though he is sober, that after all, only a bare start on A.A.’s

                <span id="pg43-p3-s2">Simple examples
like the following take on a world of meaning when we think about them. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p3-s3">Suppose a person places sex desire ahead of
everything else. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p3-s4">In such a case, this imperious urge can destroy his chances for material and emotional security as well
as his standing in the community. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p3-s5">Another may develop such an obsession for financial security that he wants to do
nothing but hoard money. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p3-s6">Going to the extreme, he can become a miser, or even a recluse who denies himself both family
and friends. </span>

                <span id="pg43-p4-s1">Nor is the quest for security always expressed in terms of money. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p4-s2">How frequently we see a frightened human being
determined to depend completely upon a stronger person for guidance and protection. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p4-s3">This weak one, failing to meet
life’s responsibilities with his own resources, never grows up. </span>

                <span id="pg43-p4-s5">In time
all his protectors either flee or die, and he is once more left alone and afraid. </span>

follows. </span>

are likely to be aroused. </span>

                <span id="pg44-p2-s5">Demands made upon other people for too much
attention, protection, and love can only invite domination or revulsion in the protectors themselves—two emotions quite
as unhealthy as the demands which evoked them. </span>

instincts can produce anything from a cold snub to a blazing revolution. </span>

activity, we may sink to such a point of despair that nothing but oblivion looks possible as a solution. </span>

                <span id="pg46-p2-s2">They can do this, for they are the carriers
of A.A.’s tested experience with Step Four. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s3">They comfort the melancholy one by first showing him that his case is not
strange or different, that his character defects are probably not more numerous or worse than those of anyone else in
A.A. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s4">This the sponsor promptly proves by talking freely and easily, and without exhibitionism, about his own defects,
past and present. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s5">This calm, yet realistic, stocktaking is immensely reassuring. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s6">The sponsor probably points out that
the newcomer has some assets which can be noted along with his liabilities. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s7">This tends to clear away morbidity and
encourage balance. </span>

at his own defects. </span>

defects. </span>

lust for sex and power, to become angry when our instinctive demands are threatened, to be envious when the ambitions of
others seem to be realized while ours are not. </span>
                <span id="pg49-p2-s4">We eat, drink, and grab for more of everything than we need, fearing we

                <span id="pg52-p2-s2">These stem from causes
which sometimes seem to be within us, and at other times to come from without. </span>

ought to consider carefully all personal relationships which bring continuous or recurring trouble. </span>

remembered that this kind of insecurity may arise in any area where instincts are threatened. </span>
                <span id="pg52-p2-s5">Questioning directed to
this end might run like this: Looking at both past and present, what sex situations have caused me anxiety, bitterness,
frustration, or depression? </span>
                <span id="pg52-p2-s6">Appraising each situation fairly, can I see where I have been at fault? </span>

perplexities beset me because of selfishness or unreasonable demands? </span>

behavior of others, why do I lack the ability to accept conditions I cannot change? </span>

                <span id="pg53-p2-s5">Either we insist
upon dominating the people we know, or we depend upon them far too much. </span>
                <span id="pg53-p2-s6">If we lean too heavily on people, they will
sooner or later fail us, for they are human, too, and cannot possibly meet our incessant demands. </span>

insecurity grows and festers. </span>

resist us heavily. </span>

                <span id="pg53-p2-s10">As we redouble our
efforts at control, and continue to fail, our suffering becomes acute and constant. </span>

a family, to be a friend among friends, to be a worker among workers, to be a useful member of society. </span>

to struggle to the top of the heap, or to hide underneath it. </span>

                <span id="pg58-p1-s2">Often it was while working on this
Step with our sponsors or spiritual advisers that we first felt truly able to forgive others, no matter how deeply we
felt they had wronged us. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p1-s3">Our moral inventory had persuaded us that all-round forgiveness was desirable, but it was only
when we resolutely tackled Step Five that we inwardly <em>knew</em> we’d be able to receive forgiveness and give it, too. </span>

misunderstood. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s2">To those who have made progress in A.A., it amounts to a clear recognition of what and who we really are,
followed by a sincere attempt to become what we could be. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s3">Therefore, our first practical move toward humility must
consist of recognizing our deficiencies. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s4">No defect can be corrected unless we clearly see what it is. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s5">But we shall have
to do more than <em>see</em>. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s6">The objective look at ourselves we achieved in Step Four was, after all, only a look. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s7">All of us
saw, for example, that we lacked honesty and tolerance, that we were beset at times by attacks of self-pity or delusions
of personal grandeur. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s8">But while this was a humiliating experience, it didn’t necessarily mean that we had yet acquired
much actual humility. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s9">Though now recognized, our defects were still there. </span>
                <span id="pg58-p2-s10">Something had to be done about them. </span>

                <span id="pg59-p1-s2">As we took inventory, we began to suspect how much trouble self-delusion had been causing us. </span>
                <span id="pg59-p1-s3">This had
brought a disturbing reflection. </span>
                <span id="pg59-p1-s4">If all our lives we had more or less fooled ourselves, how could we now be so sure that
we weren’t still self-deceived? </span>
                <span id="pg59-p1-s5">How could we be certain that we had made a true catalog of our defects and had really
admitted them, even to ourselves? </span>
                <span id="pg59-p1-s6">Because we were still bothered by fear, self-pity, and hurt feelings, it was probable
we couldn’t appraise ourselves fairly at all. </span>
                <span id="pg59-p1-s7">Too much guilt and remorse might cause us to dramatize and exaggerate our
shortcomings. </span>
                <span id="pg59-p1-s8">Or anger and hurt pride might be the smoke screen under which we were hiding some of our defects while we
blamed others for them. </span>
                <span id="pg59-p1-s9">Possibly, too, we were still handicapped by many liabilities, great and small, we never knew we
had. </span>

wouldn’t be nearly enough. </span>
                <span id="pg59-p2-s2">We’d have to have outside help if we were surely to know and admit the truth about
ourselves—the help of God and another human being. </span>
                <span id="pg59-p2-s3">Only by discussing ourselves, holding back nothing, only by being
willing to take advice and accept direction could we set foot on the road to straight thinking, solid honesty, and
genuine humility. </span>

Creator gave us our lives in the first place, then He must know in every detail where we have since gone wrong. </span>

to get used to that quite quickly. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p1-s3">Somehow, being alone with God doesn’t seem as embarrassing as facing up to another
person. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p1-s4">Until we actually sit down and talk aloud about what we have so long hidden, our willingness to clean house is
still largely theoretical. </span>

                <span id="pg60-p2-s1">The second difficulty is this: what comes to us alone may be garbled by our own rationalization and wishful thinking. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p2-s2">The benefit of talking to another person is that we can get his direct comment and counsel on our situation, and there
can be no doubt in our minds what that advice is. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p2-s3">Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p2-s4">How many times have
we heard well-intentioned people claim the guidance of God when it was all too plain that they were sorely mistaken. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p2-s5">Lacking both practice and humility, they had deluded themselves and were able to justify the most arrant nonsense on the
ground that this was what God had told them. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p2-s6">It is worth noting that people of very high spiritual development almost
always insist on checking with friends or spiritual advisers the guidance they feel they have received from God. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p2-s7">Surely,
then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion. </span>
                <span id="pg60-p2-s8">While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible, it is likely to be far more specific than any
direct guidance we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in establishing contact with a Power greater than
ourselves. </span>

A.A.’s greatest friends. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p2-s2">He goes on to explain that any person capable of enough willingness and honesty to try
repeatedly Step Six on all his faults—<em>without any reservations whatever</em>—has indeed come a long way spiritually, and
is therefore entitled to be called a man who is sincerely trying to grow in the image and likeness of his own Creator. </span>

will be answered with a prompt affirmative by almost any A.A. member. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p3-s2">To him, this proposition will be no theory at all;
it will be just about the largest fact in his life. </span>

no human being could seem to do the job for me. </span>

                <span id="pg64-p1-s2">It is plain for everybody to see that each sober A.A. member has been granted a release from this very obstinate and potentially fatal obsession. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p1-s3">So in a very complete and literal way, all A.A.’s have “become entirely ready” to have God remove the mania for alcohol from their lives. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p1-s4">And God has proceeded to do exactly that. </span>

                <span id="pg64-p2-s2">This is a riddle of our existence, the full answer to which may be only in the mind of God. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p2-s3">Nevertheless, at least a part of the answer to it is apparent to us. </span>

                <span id="pg64-p3-s2">Defying their instinctive desire for self preservation, they seem bent upon self-destruction. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p3-s3">They work against their own deepest instinct. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p3-s4">As they are humbled by the terrific beating administered by alcohol, the grace of God can enter them and expel their obsession. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p3-s5">Here their powerful instinct to live can cooperate fully with their Creator’s desire to give them new life. </span>

                <span id="pg64-p4-s2">Every normal person wants, for example, to eat, to reproduce, to be somebody in the society of his fellows. </span>

                <span id="pg65-p1-s1">It is nowhere evident, at least in this life, that our Creator expects us fully to eliminate our instinctual drives. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p1-s2">So far as we know, it is nowhere on the record that God has completely removed from any human being all his natural drives. </span>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="pg65-p2" class="p">

                <span id="pg65-p2-s1">Since most of us are born with an abundance of natural desires, it isn’t strange that we often let these far exceed their intended purpose. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p2-s2">When they drive us blindly, or we willfully demand that they supply us with more satisfactions or pleasures than are possible or due us, that is the point at which we depart from the degree of perfection that God wishes for us here on earth. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p2-s3">That is the measure of our character defects, or, if you wish, of our sins. </span>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="pg65-p3" class="p">

                <span id="pg65-p3-s1">If we ask, God will certainly forgive our derelictions. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p3-s2">But in no case does He render us white as snow and keep us that way without our cooperation. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p3-s3">That is something we are supposed to be willing to work toward ourselves. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p3-s4">He asks only that we try as best we know how to make progress in the building of character. </span>

                <span id="pg65-p4-s1">So Step Six—“Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character”—is A.A.’s way of stating the best possible attitude one can take in order to make a beginning on this lifetime job. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p4-s2">This does not mean that we expect all our character defects to be lifted out of us as the drive to drink was. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p4-s3">A few of them may be, but with most of them we shall have to be content with patient improvement. </span>
                <span id="pg65-p4-s4">The key words “entirely ready” underline the fact that we want to aim at the very best we know or can learn. </span>

                <span id="pg65-p5-s2">In an absolute sense practically nobody has it. </span>

                <span id="pg74-p1-s3">We are obliged to choose between the pains of trying and the certain penalties of failing to do so. </span>
                <span id="pg74-p1-s4">These initial steps along the road are taken grudgingly, yet we do take them. </span>

                <span id="pg74-p2-s2">By this time in all probability we have gained some measure of release from our more devastating handicaps. </span>
                <span id="pg74-p2-s3">We enjoy moments in which there is something like real peace of mind. </span>
                <span id="pg74-p2-s4">To those of us who have hitherto known only excitement, depression, or anxiety—in other words, to all of us—this newfound peace is a priceless gift. </span>
                <span id="pg74-p2-s5">Something new indeed has been added. </span>
                <span id="pg74-p2-s6">Where humility had formerly stood for a forced feeding on humble pie, it now begins to mean the nourishing ingredient which can give us serenity. </span>

                <span id="pg75-p1-s3">We heard story after story of how humility had brought strength out of weakness. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p1-s4">In every case, pain had been the price of admission into a new life. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p1-s5">But this admission price had purchased more than we expected. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p1-s6">It brought a measure of humility, which we soon discovered to be a healer of pain. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p1-s7">We began to fear pain less, and desire humility more than ever. </span>

                <span id="pg75-p2-s2">And this was true whether we had been believers or unbelievers. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p2-s3">We began to get over the idea that the Higher Power was a sort of bush-league pinch hitter, to be called upon only in an emergency. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p2-s4">The notion that we would still live our own lives, God helping a little now and then, began to evaporate. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p2-s5">Many of us who had thought ourselves religious awoke to the limitations of this attitude. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p2-s6">Refusing to place God first, we had deprived ourselves of His help. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p2-s7">But now the words “Of myself I am nothing, the Father doeth the works” began to carry bright promise and meaning. </span>

                <span id="pg75-p3-s2">It could come quite as much from our voluntary reaching for it as it could from unremitting suffering. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p3-s3">A great turning point in our lives came when we sought for humility as something we really wanted, rather than as something we <em>must</em> have. </span>
                <span id="pg75-p3-s4">It marked the time when we could commence to see the full implication of Step Seven: “Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.” </span>

                <span id="pg76-p1-s1">As we approach the actual taking of Step Seven, it might be well if we A.A.’s inquire once more just what our deeper objectives are. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p1-s2">Each of us would like to live at peace with himself and with his fellows. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p1-s3">We would like to be assured that the grace of God can do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p1-s4">We have seen that character defects based upon shortsighted or unworthy desires are the obstacles that block our path toward these objectives. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p1-s5">We now clearly see that we have been making unreasonable demands upon ourselves, upon others, and upon God. </span>

                <span id="pg76-p2-s1">The chief activator of our defects has been self-centered fear—primarily fear that we would lose something we already possessed or would fail to get something we demanded. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p2-s2">Living upon a basis of unsatisfied demands, we were in a state of continual disturbance and frustration. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p2-s3">Therefore, no peace was to be had unless we could find a means of reducing these demands. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p2-s4">The difference between a demand and a simple request is plain to anyone. </span>

                <span id="pg76-p3-s1">The Seventh Step is where we make the change in our attitude which permits us, with humility as our guide, to move out from ourselves toward others and toward God. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p3-s2">The whole emphasis of Step Seven is on humility. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p3-s3">It is really saying to us that we now ought to be willing to try humility in seeking the removal of our other shortcomings just as we did when we admitted that we were powerless over alcohol, and came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. </span>
                <span id="pg76-p3-s4">If that degree of humility could enable us to find the grace by which such a deadly obsession could be banished, then there must be hope of the same result respecting any other problem we could possibly have. </span>

away the debris of the past, we consider how, with our newfound knowledge of ourselves, we may develop the best possible
relations with every human being we know. </span>

                <span id="pg77-p3-s3">Learning
how to live in the greatest peace, partnership, and brotherhood with all men and women, of whatever description, is a
moving and fascinating adventure. </span>

until he first backtracks and really makes an accurate and unsparing survey of the human wreckage he has left in his
wake. </span>
                <span id="pg77-p3-s5">To a degree, he has already done this when taking moral inventory, but now the time has come when he ought to

                <span id="pg81-p1-s7">What happens when we wallow in depression, self-pity oozing from every pore, and inflict that upon those about us? </span>
                <span id="pg81-p1-s8">Such a roster of harms done others—the kind that make daily living with us as practicing alcoholics difficult and often unbearable—could be extended almost indefinitely. </span>
                <span id="pg81-p1-s9">When we take such personality traits as these into shop, office, and the society of our fellows, they can do damage almost as extensive as that we have caused at home. </span>

objectionable. </span>

                <span id="pg97-p2-s2">Sure, we said to ourselves, the hen probably did come before the egg. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p2-s3">No doubt the universe had a “first cause” of some sort, the God of the Atom, maybe, hot and cold by turns. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p2-s4">But certainly there wasn’t any evidence of a God who knew or cared about human beings. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p2-s5">We liked A.A. all right, and were quick to say that it had done miracles. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p2-s6">But we recoiled from meditation and prayer as obstinately as the scientist who refused to perform a certain experiment lest it prove his pet theory wrong. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p2-s7">Of course we finally did experiment, and when unexpected results followed, we felt different; in fact we <em>knew</em> different; and so we were sold on meditation and prayer. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p2-s8">And that, we have found, can happen to anybody who tries. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p2-s9">It has been well said that “almost the only scoffers at prayer are those who never tried it enough.” </span>

                <span id="pg97-p3-s3">When we refuse air, light, or food, the body suffers. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p3-s4">And when we turn away from meditation and prayer, we likewise deprive our minds, our emotions, and our intuitions of vitally needed support. </span>
                <span id="pg97-p3-s5">As the body can fail its purpose for lack of nourishment, so can the soul. </span>

                <span id="pg99-p2-s2">First let’s look at a really good prayer. </span>
                <span id="pg99-p2-s3">We won’t have far to seek; the great men and women of all religions have left us a wonderful supply. </span>

                <span id="pg99-p3-s2">We won’t be biased or scared off by that fact, because although he was not an alcoholic he did, like us, go through the emotional wringer. </span>
                <span id="pg99-p3-s3">And as he came out the other side of that painful experience, this prayer was his expression of what he could then see, feel, and wish to become: </span>

                <span id="pg100-p4-s5">Perhaps the real trouble was our almost total inability to point imagination toward the right objectives. </span>

                <span id="pg102-p2-s2">Prayer is the raising of the heart and mind to God—and in this sense it includes meditation. </span>

                <span id="pg102-p2-s4">And how does it fit in with meditation? </span>
                <span id="pg102-p2-s5">Prayer, as commonly understood, is a petition to God. </span>
                <span id="pg102-p2-s6">Having opened our channel as best we can, we try to ask for those right things of which we and others are in the greatest need. </span>
                <span id="pg102-p2-s7">And we think that the whole range of our needs is well defined by that part of Step Eleven which says: “…knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.” A request for this fits in any part of our day. </span>

                <span id="pg102-p3-s2">Perhaps we think of our day’s work and the chances it may afford us to be useful and helpful, or of some special problem that it may bring. </span>
                <span id="pg102-p3-s3">Possibly today will see a continuation of a serious and as yet unresolved problem left over from yesterday. </span>
                <span id="pg102-p3-s4">Our immediate temptation will be to ask for specific solutions to specific problems, and for the ability to help other people as we have already thought they should be helped. </span>
                <span id="pg102-p3-s5">In that case, we are asking God to do it <em>our</em> way. </span>
                <span id="pg102-p3-s6">Therefore, we ought to consider each request carefully to see what its real merit is. </span>
                <span id="pg102-p3-s7">Even so, when making specific requests, it will be well to add to each one of them this qualification: “…if it be Thy will.” We ask simply that throughout the day God place in us the best understanding of His will that we can have for that day, and that we be given the grace by which we may carry it out. </span>

                <span id="pg103-p1-s2">Just saying it over and over will often enable us to clear a channel choked up with anger, fear, frustration, or misunderstanding, and permit us to return to the surest help of all—our search for God’s will, not our own, in the moment of stress. </span>
                <span id="pg103-p1-s3">At these critical moments, if we remind ourselves that “it is better to comfort than to be comforted, to understand than to be understood, to love than to be loved,” we will be following the intent of Step Eleven. </span>

                <span id="pg103-p3-s3">Quite often, however, the thoughts that <em>seem</em> to come from God are not answers at all. </span>
                <span id="pg103-p3-s4">They prove to be well- intentioned unconscious rationalizations. </span>
                <span id="pg103-p3-s5">The A.A., or indeed any man, who tries to run his life rigidly by this kind of prayer, by this self-serving demand of God for replies, is a particularly disconcerting individual. </span>

                <span id="pg104-p2-s4">Such prayers, of course, are fundamentally good acts, but often they are based upon a supposition that we know God’s will for the person for whom we pray. </span>
                <span id="pg104-p2-s5">This means that side by side with an earnest prayer there can be a certain amount of presumption and conceit in us. </span>

                <span id="pg105-p2-s4">We are seized with a rebellion so sickening that we simply won’t pray. </span>
                <span id="pg105-p2-s5">When these things happen we should not think too ill of ourselves. </span>
                <span id="pg105-p2-s6">We should simply resume prayer as soon as we can, doing what we know to be good for us. </span>

                <span id="pg107-p3-s1">Step One showed us an amazing paradox: We found that we were totally unable to be rid of the alcohol obsession until we first admitted that we were powerless over it. </span>
                <span id="pg107-p3-s2">In Step Two we saw that since we could not restore ourselves to sanity, some Higher Power must necessarily do so if we were to survive. </span>
                <span id="pg107-p3-s3">Consequently, in Step Three we turned our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. </span>
                <span id="pg107-p3-s4">For the time being, we who were atheist or agnostic discovered that our own group, or A.A. as a whole, would suffice as a higher power. </span>
                <span id="pg107-p3-s5">Beginning with Step Four, we commenced to search out the things in ourselves which had brought us to physical, moral, and spiritual bankruptcy. </span>
                <span id="pg107-p3-s6">We made a searching and fearless moral inventory. </span>

                <span id="pg108-p1-s1">at Step Five, we decided that an inventory, taken alone, wouldn’t be enough. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s2">We knew we would have to quit the deadly business of living alone with our conflicts, and in honesty confide these to God and another human being. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s3">At Step Six, many of us balked—for the practical reason that we did not wish to have all our defects of character removed, because we still loved some of them too much. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s4">Yet we knew we had to make a settlement with the fundamental principle of Step Six. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s5">So we decided that while we still had some flaws of character that we could not yet relinquish, we ought nevertheless to quit our stubborn, rebellious hanging on to them. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s6">We said to ourselves, “This I cannot do today, perhaps, but I can stop crying out ‘No, never!’” Then, in Step Seven, we humbly asked God to remove our shortcomings such as He could or would under the conditions of the day we asked. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s7">In Step Eight, we continued our house-cleaning, for we saw that we were not only in conflict with ourselves, but also with people and situations in the world in which we lived. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s8">We had to begin to make our peace, and so we listed the people we had harmed and became willing to set things right. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s9">We followed this up in Step Nine by making direct amends to those concerned, except when it would injure them or other people. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s10">By this time, at Step Ten, we had begun to get a basis for daily living, and we keenly realized that we would need to continue taking personal inventory, and that when we were in the wrong we ought to admit it promptly. </span>
                <span id="pg108-p1-s11">In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had restored us to sanity and had enabled us to live with some peace of mind in a sorely troubled world, then such a Higher Power was worth knowing better, by as </span>

                <span id="pg109-p1-s2">The persistent use of meditation and prayer, we found, did open the channel so that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river which led to sure power and safe guidance from God as we were increasingly better able to understand Him. </span>

                <span id="pg109-p2-s2">Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubted themselves, the rest of us were able to see the change setting in. </span>
                <span id="pg109-p2-s3">From great numbers of such experiences, we could predict that the doubter who still claimed that he hadn’t got the “spiritual angle,” and who still considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently love God and call Him by name. </span>

                <span id="pg110-p3-s2">We sit in A.A. meetings and listen, not only to receive something ourselves, but to give the reassurance and support which our presence can bring. </span>

                <span id="pg110-p3-s5">There are many opportunities even for those of us who feel unable to speak at meetings or who are so situated that we cannot do much face-to-face Twelfth Step work. </span>
                <span id="pg110-p3-s6">We can be the ones who take on the unspectacular but important tasks that make good Twelfth Step work possible, perhaps arranging for the coffee and cake after the meetings, where so many skeptical, suspicious newcomers have found confidence and comfort in the laughter and talk. </span>
                <span id="pg110-p3-s7">This is Twelfth Step work in the very best sense of the word. “Freely ye have received; freely give…” is the core of this part of Step Twelve. </span>

                <span id="pg111-p1-s3">For example, we may set our hearts on getting a particular person sobered up, and after doing all we can for months, we see him relapse. </span>
                <span id="pg111-p1-s4">Perhaps this will happen in a succession of cases, and we may be deeply discouraged as to our ability to carry A.A.’s message. </span>
                <span id="pg111-p1-s5">Or we may encounter the reverse situation, in which we are highly elated because we seem to have been successful. </span>

                <span id="pg111-p1-s7">Perhaps we try to give them advice about their affairs which we aren’t really competent to give or ought not give at all. </span>
                <span id="pg111-p1-s8">Then we are hurt and confused when the advice is rejected, or when it is accepted and brings still greater confusion. </span>
                <span id="pg111-p1-s9">By a great deal of ardent Twelfth Step work we sometimes carry the message to so many alcoholics that they place us in a position of trust. </span>
                <span id="pg111-p1-s10">They make us, let us say, the group’s chairman. </span>
                <span id="pg111-p1-s11">Here again we are presented with the temptation to overmanage things, and sometimes this results in rebuffs and other con sequences which are hard to take. </span>

                <span id="pg115-p2-s2">Our demand for emotional security, for our own way, had constantly thrown us into unworkable relations with other people. </span>

                <span id="pg115-p2-s4">Either we had tried to play God and dominate those about us, or we had insisted on being overdependent upon them. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p2-s5">Where people had temporarily let us run their lives as though they were still children, we had felt very happy and secure ourselves. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p2-s6">But when they finally resisted or ran away, we were bitterly hurt and disappointed. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p2-s7">We blamed them, being quite unable to see that our unreasonable demands had been the cause. </span>

                <span id="pg115-p3-s1">When we had taken the opposite tack and had insisted, like infants ourselves, that people protect and take care of us or that the world owed us a living, then the result had been equally unfortunate. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p3-s2">This often caused the people we had loved most to push us aside or perhaps desert us entirely. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p3-s3">Our disillusionment had been hard to bear. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p3-s4">We couldn’t imagine people acting that way toward us. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p3-s5">We had failed to see that though adult in years we were still behaving childishly, trying to turn everybody—friends, wives, husbands, even the world itself—into protective parents. </span>
                <span id="pg115-p3-s6">We had refused to learn the very hard lesson that overdependence upon people is unsuccessful because all people are fallible, and even the best of them will sometimes let us down, especially when our demands for attention become unreasonable. </span>

                <span id="pg116-p1-s3">We saw that we would need to give constantly of ourselves without demands for repayment. </span>

                <span id="pg116-p2-s2">We found that dependence upon His perfect justice, forgiveness, and love was healthy, and that it would work where nothing else would. </span>
                <span id="pg116-p2-s3">If we really depended upon God, we couldn’t very well play God to our fellows nor would we feel the urge wholly to rely on human protection and care. </span>
                <span id="pg116-p2-s4">These were the new attitudes that finally brought many of us an inner strength and peace that could not be deeply shaken by the shortcomings of others or by any calamity not of our own making. </span>

                <span id="pg116-p3-s3">But when self-will had driven everybody away and our isolation had become complete, it caused us to play the big shot in cheap barrooms and then fare forth alone on the street to depend upon the charity of passersby. </span>

                <span id="pg118-p1-s2">If the man is affected, the wife must become the head of the house, often the breadwinner. </span>
                <span id="pg118-p1-s3">As matters get worse, the husband becomes a sick and irresponsible child who needs to be looked after and extricated from endless scrapes and impasses. </span>
                <span id="pg118-p1-s4">Very gradually, and usually without any realization of the fact, the wife is forced to become the mother of an erring boy. </span>
                <span id="pg118-p1-s5">And if she had a strong maternal instinct to begin with, the situation is aggravated. </span>
                <span id="pg118-p1-s6">Obviously not much partnership can exist under these conditions. </span>
                <span id="pg118-p1-s7">The wife usually goes on doing the best she knows how, but meanwhile the alcoholic alternately loves and hates her maternal care. </span>
                <span id="pg118-p1-s8">A pattern is thereby established that may take a lot of undoing later on. </span>
                <span id="pg118-p1-s9">Nevertheless, under the influence of A.A.’s Twelve Steps, these situations are often set right.* </span>

                <span id="pg121-p1-s3">There simply wouldn’t be time, we thought, to rebuild our shattered fortunes. </span>
                <span id="pg121-p1-s4">How could we ever take care of those awful debts, possess a decent home, educate the kids, and set something by for old age? </span>
                <span id="pg121-p1-s5">Financial importance was no longer our principal aim; we now clamored for material security. </span>

                <span id="pg121-p1-s8">Complete financial security we must have—or else. </span>
                <span id="pg121-p1-s9">We forgot that most alcoholics in A.A. have an earning power considerably above average; we forgot the immense goodwill of our brother A.A.’s who were only too eager to help us to better jobs when we deserved them; we forgot the actual or potential financial insecurity of every human being in the world. </span>
                <span id="pg121-p1-s10">And, worst of all, we forgot God. </span>

                <span id="pg121-p2-s2">When a job still looked like a mere means of getting money rather than an opportunity for service, when the acquisition of money for financial independence looked more important than a right dependence upon God, we were still the victims of unreasonable fears. </span>
                <span id="pg121-p2-s3">And these were fears which would make a serene and useful existence, at any financial level, quite impossible. </span>

                <span id="pg124-p2-s1">But today, in well-matured A.A.’s, these distorted drives have been restored to something like their true purpose and direction. </span>
                <span id="pg124-p2-s2">We no longer strive to dominate or rule those about us in order to gain self-importance. </span>
                <span id="pg124-p2-s3">We no longer seek fame and honor in order to be praised. </span>
                <span id="pg124-p2-s4">When by devoted service to family, friends, business, or community we attract widespread affection and are sometimes singled out for posts of greater responsibility and trust, we try to be humbly grateful and exert ourselves the more in a spirit of love and service. </span>
                <span id="pg124-p2-s5">True leadership, we find, depends upon able example and not upon vain displays of power or glory. </span>

                <span id="pg124-p3-s1">Still more wonderful is the feeling that we do not have to be specially distinguished among our fellows in order to be useful and profoundly happy. </span>
                <span id="pg124-p3-s2">Not many of us can be leaders of prominence, nor do we wish to be. </span>
                <span id="pg124-p3-s3">Service, gladly rendered, obligations squarely met, troubles well accepted or solved with God’s help, the knowledge that at home or in the world outside we are partners in a common effort, the well-understood fact that in God’s sight all human beings are important, the proof that love freely given surely brings a full return, the certainty that we are no longer isolated and alone in self-constructed prisons, the surety that we need no longer be square pegs in round holes but can fit and belong in God’s scheme of things—these are the permanent and legitimate satisfactions of right living </span>

been talking about problems because we are problem people who have found a way up and out, and who wish to share our
knowledge of that way with all who can use it. </span>
